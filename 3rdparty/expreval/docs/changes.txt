IFEM Hacks
----------
- Added a define in defs.h. auto_ptr is deprecated in c++0x. uses
std::unique_ptr instead. Quells the warnings
- add support for exponential format (e.g. 1e-1) for constants
- add support for 'pow' function
- Improved exception handling
- Added integration with autodiff

ExprEval 3.6
------------
- Removed support for arbitrary data objects.  It seemed unused anyhow.
- Fixed locale handling.  It can now parse expressions correctly no matter
  what locale the program is in.

ExprEval 3.3
------------
- Added support for arbitrary data objects to be passed to functions
  with the '@' operator.  The expression library itself does not have
  any understanding of the arbitrary data, but the functions can.

ExprEval 3.2
------------
- Added Exception::GetType method to determine the type of error
  without needing many catch statements.

ExprEval 3.1
------------
- Removed Exception::what due to language problems.  Each application should
  do testing and report the exception to the user itself, in whatever language
  it needs.
- Added Exception::GetStart and Exception::GetEnd to report where in the
  expression string the error occurs when parsing.
- Added Exception::GetValue to get the name of the object, function, etc
  that is responsible for an exception, depending on the exception itself
- In header files, replaced 'std::X' with '::std::X'
